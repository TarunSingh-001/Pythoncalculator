# Pythoncalculator
Command in Line calculator using Python
The program defines functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and uses a main() loop for continuous interaction. Users select the desired operation and input numbers. The result is displayed with an appropriate symbol, and the calculator repeats until the user exits.
